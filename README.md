# Age of Sigmar Random Hero generator
This webapp will let you generate a random hero to build, based on "The Anvil of Apotheosis" rules outlined in the General's Handbook 2020 for Age of Sigmar.

The focus will be to generate an idea for a hero you could kitbash, and won't include any stats or rules to tell you how to expand them further.  Specifically, it will generate the Ancestry, Weaponry, Archetype, Beastial Companion, and a few upgrades that you may want to represent on the final model.
